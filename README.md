This project is an introduction to the Godot engine following along the 2D game tutorial provided by the Godot Documentation.

ðŸš€ Your First 2D Game in Godot â€“ Dodge the Creeps! ðŸŽ®

This step-by-step tutorial guides you through creating your first complete 2D game using the Godot Engine. By the end, you'll have a simple yet fully functional game where the player must dodge enemies for as long as possible!

âœ¨ What You'll Learn

âœ… Setting up a Godot project
âœ… Creating and coding a player character
âœ… Spawning random enemies
âœ… Implementing a score system
âœ… Structuring a game project

This tutorial is beginner-friendly but assumes basic programming knowledge. If you're new to programming, check out Godot's Scripting Languages first.
